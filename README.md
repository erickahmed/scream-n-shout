# Scream n Shout - Arduino alarm system
 A barebone alarm system developed as fast as possible as a breach detection system for my dorm room that was needed asap.

 The code may not be perfect, but it's a good-enough alarm for something that has been developed in 20 minutes and some basic hardware components.

 It detects a potential breach using a ultrasonic sensor, sends alarm signal to a buzzer and writes 1 to a specific EEPROM address, read by a led that tells you if someone entered the room while you were gone.

 A version with more than a single-bit capability to signal a breach will be developed :)
